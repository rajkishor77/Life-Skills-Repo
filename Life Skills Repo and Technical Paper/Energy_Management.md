## Question 2: When do you find getting into the Stress quadrant?  
Stress happens when challenges feel bigger than our comfort zone. It can be positive for growth, but too much is harmful. Common situations where stress comes up are:  

- **Exams or project deadlines**: Pressure to perform within limited time.  
- **Learning something difficult**: Struggling with new skills creates stress.  
- **Interviews or presentations**: Fear of judgment and high expectations.  
- **Too many tasks at once**: Overload of responsibilities without proper rest.  
- **Unexpected failures**: When things don’t go as planned, stress levels increase.  

Stress is normal and even helpful if managed, but staying too long in stress can cause burnout.

To improve sleep quality, we need good daily habits. Some ideas are:  

- **Fixed sleep schedule**: Sleeping and waking up at the same time every day trains the body.  
- **No mobile/laptop before bed**: Blue light from screens keeps the brain active and delays sleep.  
- **Dark and quiet bedroom**: A calm environment improves sleep.  
- **Less caffeine at night**: Tea, coffee, or energy drinks disturb natural sleep.  
- **Relaxing activities before bed**: Reading or meditation helps the mind slow down.

These steps help to sleep faster, deeper, and wake up fresh.
