# Learning Process

## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique
**Question 1:** What is the Feynman Technique?  
**Answer:** The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that emphasizes understanding by explaining concepts in simple, clear terms, as if teaching them to someone else. This helps identify gaps in knowledge and ensures deeper understanding rather than rote memorization.

## 2. Learning How to Learn by Barbara Oakley
**Question 2:** Most interesting story or idea:  
**Answer:** The most interesting idea was the concept of **two modes of thinking**: the focused (active) mode and the diffused (relaxed) mode. Strategically switching between these modes allows more effective problem-solving, better retention, and improved learning efficiency.

**Question 3:** What are active and diffused modes of thinking?  
**Answer:**  
- **Active (Focused) Mode:** Concentrated attention on a specific problem or concept. Logical and structured thinking allows detailed understanding and problem-solving.  
- **Diffused Mode:** Relaxed, big-picture thinking that helps form new connections and insights, often leading to creative solutions.

**Question 4:** Steps to take when approaching a new topic:  
1. **Deconstruct the skill:** Break the topic into smaller, manageable sub-skills.  
2. **Learn enough to self-correct:** Gain sufficient understanding to recognize and fix mistakes.  
3. **Remove barriers to learning:** Eliminate distractions, gather necessary tools, and create a conducive environment.  
4. **Practice deliberately:** Dedicate at least 20 hours of focused practice to reach meaningful proficiency.
