## 1. Tiny Habits - BJ Fogg  
**Question 1**  

The most interesting idea for me in this video was how small changes can lead to big results. BJ Fogg explained that even a tiny habit, like flossing one tooth or doing two push-ups, can grow into something big over time. It showed me that starting small is better than waiting for the perfect time.

## 2. Tiny Habits by BJ Fogg - Core Message  

**Question 2**  

BJ Fogg used the formula **B = MAP**.  

- **M = Motivation** – How much you want to do the habit.  
- **A = Ability** – How easy or difficult it is to do.  
- **P = Prompt** – A reminder or trigger to start the habit.  

This makes new habits easier because if motivation is low, we can increase ability (make it easier) or add a clear prompt.  

**Question 3**  

It is important to celebrate after completing a habit because celebration makes us feel good. When we feel good, our brain remembers it, and we want to repeat it. This is how habits become strong.

## 3. 1% Better Every Day Video  

**Question 4**  

The most interesting idea in this video was the concept of improving just 1% every day. Over time, small improvements add up and create a big difference. This made me realize that progress does not need to be huge; consistency matters more.

## 4. Book Summary of Atomic Habits  

**Question 5**  

The book’s perspective about **Identity** is that habits shape who we are. If we focus on becoming the type of person who does an action (identity), then habits stick better.  
Example: Instead of saying *“I want to run,”* say *“I am a runner.”*  

**Question 6**  

The book says to make a habit easier, you should reduce friction. For example, keep your workout clothes ready or keep a water bottle near you. The easier it is to start, the more likely you’ll do it.  

**Question 7**  

To make a habit harder, the book suggests adding friction. For example, if you want to use less social media, log out of apps, delete shortcuts, or keep your phone in another room.
