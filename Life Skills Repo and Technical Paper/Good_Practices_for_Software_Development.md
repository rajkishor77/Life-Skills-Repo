# Good Practices for Software Development

## 1. Gathering Requirements
- Take notes while discussing requirements with your team.  
- Always ask questions in the meeting itself to clear doubts.  
- If no tool like Trello or Jira is used, write down the requirements and share them with your team.  
- This helps you get feedback and also works as a reference later.  
- Sometimes requirements remain unclear. In such cases, keep asking for feedback during implementation to stay on the right track.

## 2. Always Over-Communicate
- If requirements change and deadlines are affected, inform the team immediately.  
- If you have issues like no internet, laptop problem, or electricity issues, let your team know.  
- If implementation is taking longer, update the team.  
- Use group chats/channels instead of private DMs so everyone stays informed.  
- Don’t miss calls. If busy, pick up and say you’ll call back in 5–10 minutes.  
- In meetings, keep your video on for better communication and bonding.

## 3. Stuck? Ask Questions
- Ask questions in a clear way so others can answer easily.  
- Avoid vague messages like "build is not working."  
- Explain the problem, share what you tried to fix it.  
- Use screenshots, diagrams, or screencast tools like Loom.  
- Share code using GitHub Gists, CodePen, or CodeSandbox.  
- Learn from how open-source projects report issues.

## 4. Get to Know Your Teammates
- Spend time understanding the company, product, and team members.  
- Join meetings 5–10 minutes early to connect casually.  
- Learn your teammates’ schedules to plan calls at the right time.  

---

## 5. Be Aware and Mindful of Others
- Your teammates may not always be available for calls.  
- Instead of sending multiple messages, combine all your questions into one.  
- Be responsive when they reply — real-time conversations are faster.  
- Respect their workload and choose communication channels wisely.

## 6. Doing Things with 100% Involvement
- Remote work is still real work.  
- Programming needs deep focus and attention.  
- Protect your attention — this skill improves with time.

- Follow "Work when you work, play when you play."  
- Keep your phone on silent and remove social media distractions.  
- Block social media apps during work hours (e.g., using Freedom, TimeLimit).  
- Track your time with apps like [Boosted](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boostedproductivity.app&hl=en_IN).  
- Eat properly to maintain energy.  
- Exercise regularly to stay active and focused.
